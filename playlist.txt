hull
i've travelled the land with a guitar in my hand
and an eye ever open for some fun
i've made some mistakes, had my share of the breaks
seen the boys on the make and on the bum
run for home, run as fast as i can
oh, running man, running for home
run for home, run as fast as i can
oh, running man, running for home
i've seen all the frowns on the faces of the clowns
and the downs that they take just to be free
i've seen all the girls in their pretty frocks and curls
but they don't mean a lot to me
run for home, run as fast as i can
oh, running man, running for home
i've been to the places in town where the faces
hang 'round just to stare at each other
i've looned with them, scream at the moon
behaved like a buffoon but i soon discovered
run for home, run as fast as i can
oh, running man, running for home
run for home, run as fast as i can
oh, running man, running for home
run for home, run as fast as i can
oh, running man, running for home
i've travelled the land, made mistakes out of hand
seen the faces in the places misunderstand
yes, i've travelled the world, seen the pretty boys and girls
heard the noise that destroys and commands
run for home, run as fast as i can
oh, running man, running for home
run for home, run as fast as i can
oh, running man, running for home
if i could have all the women in the world
i would take this time to leave
the pressure's on and i'm not some kind of strong man
so take this thing from me
don't give it a second thought
i can see you got better things to do
so just take your things and leave

she's cold and she's cruel
but she knows what she's doing
she pushed me in the pool
at our last school reunion
she laughs at my dreams
but i dream about her laughter
strange as it seems
she's the one i'm after
'cause she's bittersweet
she knocks me off of my feet
and i can't help myself
i don't want anyone else
she's a mystery
she's too much for me
but i keep coming back for more
she's just the girl i'm looking for
she can't keep a secret
for more than an hour
she runs on 100
 proof attitude power
and the more she ignores me
the more i adore her
what can i do?
i'd do anything for her
'cause she's bittersweet
she knocks me off of my feet
and i can't help myself
i don't want anyone else
she's a mystery
she's too much for me
but i keep coming back for more
she's just the girl i'm looking for
and when she sees it's me
on her caller id
she won't pick up the phone
she'd rather be alone
but i can't give up just yet
'cause every word she's ever said
is still ringing in my head
still ringing in my head
she's cold and she's cruel
but she knows what she's doing
knows just what to say
so my whole day is ruined
'cause she's bittersweet
she knocks me off of my feet
and i can't help myself
i don't want anyone else
she's a mystery
she's too much for me
but i keep coming back for more
'cause she's bittersweet
she knocks me off of my feet
and i can't help myself
i don't want anyone else
she's a mystery
she's too much for me
but i keep coming back for more
oh, i keep coming back for more
she's just the girl i'm looking for
just the girl i'm looking for

telephone operator

telephone operator

that i'm in because
i'm only thinking of you
telephone operator
well i know it
it's a shame
a shame i can't show it
and i see it
i can see it now
but i'm so far below it
don't wanna
don't wanna talk about it
i say why not?
don't wanna think about it
i say there's got to be some good reason
for your little black backpack
up, smack, turn around he's on his back and
don't wanna tango with you
i'd rather tangle with him
i think i'm gonna bash his head in
and this shouldn't concern you except that
just don't expect to get your bloody black backpack back
and i can feel you
yes i can
what about that don't you understand?
and i sense you
it's something sensual
but it's less than i planned
don't wanna...
you're trying to find a reason for the way you feel tonight
your mind is lined with layers of lead
have you heard one thing that i've said?
memories are just where you leave them
drag the waters, 'til the depths give up their dead
what did you expect to find?
was it something you left behind?
don't you remember anything i said when i said
don't fall away and leave me to myself
don't fall away and leave love bleeding
in my hands, in my hands again
leave love bleeding
in my hands, in my hands
love lies bleeding
"oh, hold me now, i feel contagious"
"am i the only place that you've left to go?"
she cries her life is like
some movie, black and white
dead actors faking lines
over and over and over again she cries
don't fall away and leave me to myself
don't fall away and leave love bleeding
in my hands, in my hands again
leave love bleeding
in my hands, in my hands
love lies bleeding
and i wanted you to turn away
you don't remember, but i do
you never even tried
don't fall away, and leave me to myself
don't fall away, and leave love bleeding
in my hands, in my hands again
leave love bleeding
in my hands, in my hands again
leave love bleeding
in my hands, in my hands again
leave love bleeding
in my hands, in my hands again
whoa, ooh, oh
so long ago, i don't remember when
that's when they say i lost my only friend
well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
as i listened through the cemetery trees
i seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
the long broken arm of human law
now it always seemed such a waste,
she always had a pretty face
so i wondered why she hung around this place
hey
come on, try a little
nothing is forever
there's got to be something better than
in the middle
but me and cinderella
we'll put it all together
we can drive it home
with one headlight
she said, "it's cold, it feels like independence day
and i can't break away from this parade"
but there's got to be an opening
somewhere here in front of me
through this maze of ugliness and greed
and i seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
we'll run until she's out of breath
she ran until there's nothing left
she hit the end, it's just her window ledge
hey
come on, try a little
nothing is forever
there's got to be something better than
in the middle
but me and cinderella
we put it all together
we can drive it home
with one headlight
[guitar solo]
well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
i turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
what smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
this place is always such a mess
sometimes i think i'd like to watch it burn
i'm so alone, and i feel just like somebody else
man, i ain't changed, but i know i ain't the same
but somewhere here in between
the city walls of dying dreams
i think her death, it must be killing me
hey, hey, hey
come on, try a little
nothing is forever
there's got to be something better than
in the middle
but me and cinderella
we put it all together
we can drive it home
with one headlight
[guitar solo outro]
you don't know how you move me
deconstruct me
and consume me
i'm all used up
i'm out of luck
i am starstuck
by something in your eyes
that is keeping my hope alive
but i'm sick of myself when i look at you
something is beautiful and true
in a world that's ugly and a lie
it's hard to even want to try
and i'm beginning to think
baby you don't know
i'll take or leave
the room to breathe
the choice to leave you
i'll throw away
a chance at greatness
just to make this
dream come into play
i don't know if i'll find a way
'cause i'm sick of myself when i look at you
something is beautiful and true
in a world that's ugly and a lie
it's hard to even want to try
and i'm beginning to think
baby you don't know
and i'm beginning to think
baby you don't know
there's something in your eyes
that is keeping my hope alive
cause i'm sick of myself when i look at you
something is beautiful and true
in a world that's ugly and a lie
it's hard to even want to try
and i'm beginning to think
baby you don't know
and i'm beginning to think
baby you don't know
break your happy home
learn to sing along
to the music, to the music
clap your hands and shake
on a summer's day
to the music, to the music

too bad that you had to get caught
that's not like you to lose face
so sad that you're not as smart
as you thought you were in the first place
baby
i could use some of your persuasion
to wipe away, wipe, wipe, a-wipe-a-wipe-a-wipe away
the taste of your machinations
it's over
kaput except for the tailspin
save the dialogue, baby, save your dialogue
for the old men in the pool room
[pre-chorus]
try it once, well, i'm not so sure
try it twice and you're by my door
too bad that you had to get caught
that's not like you to lose face
so sad that you're not as smart
as you thought you were in the first place
all your money
no more than a insulation
oh to get away, get, get, a-get-a-get-a-get away
i watch with a fascination
well, a hideaway
ooh, such imagination
oh, the forty-five, goodbye!
i used it with no hesitation
it's too bad (too bad), too bad (too bad)
too bad, too bad
too bad that you had to get caught
that's not like you to lose face
so sad that you're not as smart
as you thought you were in the first place
too bad (too bad), too bad (too bad)
too bad, it's too bad
so sad (so sad), so sad (so sad)
so sad, it's so sad
it's too bad, too bad (too bad, too bad)
oh baby, won't ya listen to me? (too bad)
it's so sad, so sad (so sad, so sad)
oh baby, i can tell you that (so sad)
too bad, too bad (too bad, too bad)

(dreaming of black and white)

when i was a young boy
i wanted to sail around the world
that's the life for me
living on the sea
spirit of a sailor
circumnavigates the globe
the lust of a pioneer
will acknowledge no frontier
[pre-chorus]
i remember you by
thunderclap in the sky
lightning flash, tempers flare
'round the horn, if you dare
i just spent six months in a leaky boat
lucky just to keep afloat
da da da da, daaa da doh doh doh doh doh da doh doh
aotearoa
rugged individual
glisten like a pearl
at the bottom of the world
the 
tyranny of distance
didn't stop the cavalier
so why should it stop me?
i'll conquer and stay free
[pre-chorus]
ah, c'mon all you lads
let's forget and forgive
there's a world to explore
tales to tell back on shore
i just spent six months in a leaky boat
six months in a leaky boat
da da da da, daaa da doh doh doh doh doh da doh doh
[instrumental break]
[pre-chorus]
ship-wrecked love can be cruel
don't be fooled by her kind
there's a wind in my sails
will protect and prevail
i just spent six months in a leaky boat
nothing to it, leaky boat
da da da da, daaa da doh doh doh doh doh da doh doh
don't you know what you're doing?
you've got a death wish
[yeah?]
suicide blonde, suicide blonde
suicide blonde, suicide blonde
suicide blonde was the colour of her hair
like a cheap distraction
for a new affair
she knew it would finish
before it began
woah baby, you lost the plan
you want to make her
suicide blonde
love devastation
suicide blonde
you want to make her
suicide blonde
love devastation
suicide blonde
she stripped to the beat
but her clothes stay on
white light everywhere
but you can't see a thing
such a squeeze
a mad, sad moment
glory to you, glory to you, take me there
oooo, take me there
got some revelation put into your hands
save you from your misery
like rain across the land
don't you see
the colour of deception
turning your world around again
you want to make her
suicide blonde
love devastation
suicide blonde
you want to make her
suicide blonde
love devastation
suicide blonde
say it:
you want to make
you want to make
you want to make her
suicide blonde
you want to make
that's the story
everything you wanna be
everything you are, are
mmmmm
yeah
you want to make her
suicide blonde
love devastation
suicide blonde
you want to make her
suicide blonde
love devastation
suicide blonde
yeah

you want to make her
suicide blonde
love devastation
suicide blonde
you want to make her
ain't got no regrets
i ain't losin' track
of which way i'm going
i ain't gonna double back, no
don't want no misplay
put on no display
an angel? no!
but i know my way, oh yeah, oh
i used follow
yeah, that's true
but my following days are over
now i just gotta follow through
and i remember what my father said
he said "son, life is simple"
it's either cherry red or
midnight blue, oh, oh
midnight blue, oh, oh
you were the restless one
and you did not care
that i was the trouble boy
lookin' for a double dare
i won't apologize for
the things i've done and said
but when i win your heart
i'm gonna paint it cherry red
i don't want to talk about it
what you do to me
i can't live without it
and you might think that
it's much too soon
for us to go this far
into the midnight blue, oh, oh
it's midnight blue, oh, oh
things could be different
but that'd be a shame, 'cause
i'm the one who could feel the sun
right in the pouring rain
i won't say where
and i don't know when
but soon there's gonna come a day, baby
i'll be back again
yeah, i'll be back for you
you see, i'm saving up my love
midnight blue, oh, oh
into the midnight blue, oh, oh
another midnight blue, oh, oh
the deepest midnight blue, oh, oh
(that's what i gotta do)
into the midnight blue, oh, oh
midnight blue, oh, oh
midnight blue, oh, oh
the deepest midnight blue, oh, oh
i walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
and every step i take reminds me of just how we used to be
oh how can i forget you, girl
when there is always something there to remind me
always something there to remind me
shadows fall, i pass the small cafwhere we would dance at night
and i can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight
how can i forget you, girl
when there is always something there to remind me
always something there to remind me
i was born to love her
and i will never be free
you'll always be a part of me
woah woah wooah
if you should find to miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
just go back to the places where we used to go and i'll be there
oh how can i forget you, girl
when there is always something there to remind me
always something there to remind me
i was born to love her
and i will never be free
you'll always be a part of me
when there is always something there to remind me
always something there to remind me (repeat till end)
destination outward bound
i turn to see the northern lights behind the wing
horizons seem to beckon me
learned how to cry too young, so now i live to sing
the northern lights are in my mind
they guide me back to you
horizons seem to beckon me
learned how to cry too young, so now i live to sing
you know it's hard away from you
travelling roads and passing through
it's not for money and it's not for fame
i just can't explain, sometimes it's lonely
marking the space between the days
early hours pass away
i sing to you of northern lights
i sing for you of northern nights
past or future, here or there
shelter comes in words from you, so talk to me
i hear your voice, it comforts me
in morning dreams i take your hand, you walk with me
the northern lights are in my mind
they guide me back to you
peace enfolds the still night air
home again i look for you and find you there
destination homeward now
take the easy way, bring me down
making the hard way now i see
hard to be really free, i'm missing you near me
marking the space between the days
early hours pass away
i sing to you of northern lights
i sing for you of northern nights
the northern lights are in my mind
they guide me back to you
the northern nights are in my eyes
they guide me back to you
the northern lights are in my mind
they guide me back to you
the northern nights are in my eyes
they guide me back to you
the northern lights are in my mind
they guide me back to you
sometimes you have no choice
sometimes you've got no voice to say
say if you will the words
say if your world is so gray
we can decide this
there'll be no tears
no tradgedy
try i wouldn't break and cry, if
you walk away
and leave me
hey, goodbye
goodbye is forever
hey, forever
goodbye is
forever and ever
sometimes it makes no sense
this side of cruel coincidence
caught up in our own barbed wire
to set us free
belive this
hey, goodbye
goodbye is forever
hey, forever
goodbye is
forever and ever
hey, goodbye
goodbye is forever
hey, forever
goodbye is
forever and ever
hey, goodbye
goodbye is forever
hey, forever
goodbye is
forever and ever
you had something to hide
should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
now you're not satisfied
with what you're being put through
it's just time to pay the price
for not listening to advice
and deciding in your youth
on the policy of truth
things could be so different now
it used to be so civilised
you will always wonder how
it could have been if you'd only lied
it's too late to change events
it's time to face the consequence
for delivering the proof
in the policy of truth
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
now you're standing there tongue-tied
you'd better learn your lesson well
hide what you have to hide
and tell what you have to tell
you'll see your problems multiplied
if you continually decide
to faithfully pursue
the policy of truth
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
[interlude]
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
never again is what you swore
the time before
stand up in a clear blue morning
until you see what can be
alone in a cold day dawning
are you still free? can you be?
when some cold tomorrow finds you
when some sad old dream reminds you
how the endless road unwinds you
while you see a chance take it
find romance fake it
because it's all on you
don't you know by now
no one gives you anything?
and don't you wonder how you keep on moving?
one more day your way, oh your way
when there's no one left to leave you
even you don't quite believe you
that's when nothing can deceive you
while you see a chance take it
find romance fake it
because it's all on you
stand up in a clear blue morning
until you see what can be
alone in a cold day dawning
are you still free? can you be?
and that old gray wind is blowing
and there's nothing left worth knowing
and its time you should be going
while you see a chance take it
find romance fake it
because it's all on you
while you see a chance take it
find romance
while you see a chance take it
find romance
while you see a chance take it
find romance
while you see a chance take it
find romance
while you see a chance take it
find romance
while you see a chance take it
find romance
it was late in december, the sky turned to snow
all round the day was goin' down slow
night like a river beginning to flow
i felt the beat of my mind go
drifting into time passages
years go falling in the fading light
time passages
buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
well i'm not the kind to live in the past
the years run too short and the days too fast
the things you lean on, are the things that don't last
well it's just now and then, my line gets cast into these
time passages
there's something back here that you left behind
oh, time passages
buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
don't know why you should feel
that there's something to learn
it's just a game that you play
well the picture is changing, 
now you're part of a crowd
they're laughing at something, and the music's loud
a girl comes towards you, you once used to know
you reach out your hand, but you're all alone in these
time passages
i know you're in there, you're just out of sight
oh, time passages
buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
south bound drive on a desert night
cruise control at 95
watching for the vegas lights
still not sure how we all got in
with white shirts and innocence
heaven's on a hold again
baby, and i said
oh, my my my
i saw you from across the room
black dress and sunday shoes
and i said
oh, my my my
i always knew you broke the rules
i see it in the way you move
this is nothing new
you were a girl that i'd seen around
i never heard you make a sound
you always had your head down
but there was something in the way you walked
i couldn't resist the thought
that someday i'd find you here where we'd never get caught and
oh, my my my
i saw you from across the room
black dress and sunday shoes
and i said
oh, my my my
i always knew you broke the rules
i see it in the way you move
this is nothing new
oh now, baby
oh no
this is nothing
this is nothing new
oh, nothing baby
this is nothing new
come on baby
and i said
oh my my my
i saw you from across the room
black dress and sunday shoes
i said oh, my my my
i always knew you broke the rules
i see it in the way you move
this is nothing new
this is nothing
this is nothing
this is nothing new
this is nothing new
i see the way, see the way you move
our hearts are free
so tell me what's wrong with the feeling
i'm a flower, you're the bee
it's much older than you and me
i'm in love, i'm alive
i belong to the stars and sky
let's forget who we are for one night
we're not animals, baby
it's the people who lie (to themselves)
i want real love, baby
ooh, don't leave me waiting
i've got real love maybe
wait until you taste me
i want real love, baby
there's a world inside me
got the key, just use it
just if for a minute (and gone)
our hearts are free
so tell me what's wrong with the feeling
i'm a flower, you're the bee
it's much older than you and me
i'm in love, i'm alive
i belong to the stars and sky
let's forget who we are for one night
we're not animals, baby
it's the people who lie (to themselves)
i want real love, baby
ooh, don't leave me waiting
i've got real love maybe
wait until you taste me
i want real love, baby
there's a world inside me
got the key, just use it
just if for a minute (and gone)
i want real love, baby
ooh, don't leave me waiting
i've got real love maybe
wait until you taste me
i want real love, baby
there's a world inside me
got the key, just use it
just if for a minute (and gone)
[collision: verse + 
our hearts are free
so tell me what's wrong with the feeling
i'm a flower, you're the bee
it's much older than you and me
i'm in love, i'm alive

let's forget who we are for one night
we're not animals, baby

i was paralyzed
as i opened up my bloodshot eyes
do i really wanna know
where i've been or where i've put my nose
i'm in a rut
keep kicking myself in the nuts
in a stairwell i seek
the lair where i stuck my dirty beak
so i'm back again it's ok
well be that as it may
over and over away
into the fires unknown
into oblivion through sticks and stones
pick up the phone - my jacks are all blown
oh these nights out alone
come carry me home
a habit hard to break
take me home good lord for heavens sake
the doctor's not in
got no cure for the medicine
so i'm back again it's ok
well be that as it may
over and over away
into the fires unknown
into oblivion through sticks and stones
pick up the phone - listen to me moan
oh these nights out alone
come carry me home
everytime i make the round i turn around
i'm put upon the rack
everytime i stand up i fall flat on my face
and break my back
tombstoned and chicken shacked
into the fires unknown
into oblivion through sticks and stones
pick up the phone - my jacks are all blown
[?]
[?]
oh these nights out alone
carry me home
sombody carry me home
let me convince you to come away with me
you've never been somewhere so loud
i find you another room, i have to pay your rent
but the way i keep my promise feels so confident
[pre-chorus]
pick me up, it's never boring
and every dollar spent
we could always drive together
get-away weekend
pick me up, it's never boring
and your every dollar spent
we could always drive together
get-away weekend
come away with me
for a month or three weeks
you've never felt so free
on a reality
oh, come away with me
for a month or three weeks
you've never felt so free
on a reality
(the song is never ending
our song is dragging on
what heaps on top the memory
the things you look back on
although we love to party
with all our friends around
it gets uncomfortable when
they're lookin' for me now)
out together, dancing with our friends
you know it should've been a moment to remember well
up and down back avenue
the most you'd ever want
to try less talk and do as you want
[pre-chorus]
pick me up, it's never boring
with every dollar spent
we could always drive together
get-away weekend
pick me up, it's never boring
and your every dollar spent
we could always drive together
get-away weekend
come away with me
for a month or three weeks
you've never felt so free
on a reality
oh, come away with me
for a month or three weeks
you've never felt so free
on a reality
(the song is never ending
our song is dragging on
what heaps on top the memory
the things you look back on
although we love to party
with all our friends around
it gets uncomfortable when
they're lookin' for me now)
i got a girl that lives at the mall
she dances on the dark side of the disco ball
drives a silver mercedes
made in the 80s
swears and stares at the buckhead ladies
she straddles me lovely
while she scratches my back
while she sings all the words
to my hidden tracks
from my heart of a record, far as i can tell
sounds like heaven and feels good as hell
b-b-b-b-baby yer so hot
ya g-g-g-g-g-give me everything i got
c-c-c-c-c-c-can ya tell me how to not
love a hot girl in a good mood
back before i ever even knew how you felt
when i was just a teenage bullet belt
making really heavy music
in a bandana band
playing spring break parties
in the redneck sand
your lips are like a work of art..
god i wanna tear them apart..
she's out of luck
and out of hope
and out of cigarettes
misunderstood, with naked pictures on the internet
her social deviance is teasing me
i know what i want
and i'm really gonna, really let her know (woah)
that i like her, but i just don't care enough
to fool around with love
yeah, 
my baby's pretty as a car crash
sexy as the stinger of a hornet in your arm
just another modern swinger
screaming catch me if you can
with a cigarette in hand
and its love
it's heavy and it hurts and it's love
strung out on blow
she doesn't know why she's not feeling good
dropped out of school
and now she's moving out to hollywood
her reckless decadence
is taking things a little too far
and i'm really gonna, really let her know (woah)
that i like her, but i just don't care enough
to fool around with love
yeah, my baby's pretty as a car crash, subtle as a splinter
yeah, my baby's smooth as sandpaper, warm just like the winter
screaming catch me if you can
with a cigarette in hand
and its love
it's heavy and it hurts and it's love
staring at my shoes, thinking of something to say
but nothing's better than what silence is saying
when every time i turn around, she's always looking away
it's just the nature of the game that we're playing
and i think im tapping out
i think im gonna skip the title bout
yeah, my baby's pretty as a car crash
sexy as the stinger of a hornet in your arm
just another modern swinger
screaming catch me if you can
with a cigarette in hand
and its love
it's heavy and it hurts and it's love
yeah, my baby's pretty as a car crash, subtle as a splinter
yeah, my baby's smooth as sandpaper, warm just like the winter
screaming catch me if you can
with a cigarette in hand
and its love
it's heavy and it hurts
and she's pretty as a car crash
sexy as the stinger of a hornet in your arm
just another modern swinger
screaming catch me if you can
with a cigarette in hand
and its love
it's heavy and it hurts and it's love
where are those happy days, them see so hard to find
i tried to reach for you, but you have close your mind
whatever happened to our love?
i wish i understood
it used to be so nice, it used to be so good
so when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
s.o.s
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me
s.o.s
when you're gone
how can i even tried to go on?
when you're gone
though i try how can i carry on?
you seem so far away though you are standing near
you made me feel alive, but something died i fear
i really tried to make it out
i wish i understood
what happened to our love, it used to be so good
so when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
s.o.s
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me
s.o.s
when you're gone
how can i even tried to go on?
when you're gone
though i try how can i carry on?
so when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
s.o.s
the love you gave me, nothing else can save me
s.o.s
when you're gone
how can i even tried to go on?
when you're gone
though i try how can i carry on?
when you're gone
how can i even tried to go on?
when you're gone
though i try how can i carry on?
here we go, i'm hanging out in camden
drinking with my girlfriends on a saturday night
this guy says, "come and meet my girlfriend"
she's sitting in the corner looking rather uptight
so i say hello and i try to be nice
but i see he's feeling itchy
trying to play us off each other
"girls, girls, please don't fight"
(you get the picture)
hey you, the muscles and the long hair
telling me that women are superior to men
most guys just don't appreciate this
you just try convincing me you're better than them
so he talks for hours about his sensitive soul
and his favourite subject is sex
i don't even think he really wanted it
but christ, this guy's too much
(i wanna tell him)
i'm as human as the next girl
i like a bit of flattery
but i don't need your practised lines
your school of charm mentality
so save your breath for someone else
and credit me with something more
when it comes to men like you
i know the score, i've heard it all before
(here comes the next one)
blondie was with me for a summer
he flirted like a maniac but i wouldn't bite
i'm weak and he was so persistent
he only had to have me 'cause i put up a fight
oh god, the boy had such an ego
he liked to talk about himself all day and all night
you think you're such a ladykiller
but you were nothing special 'til you turned out the light
when he's nice to me he's just nice to himself
and he's watching his reflection
i'm a five-foot mirror for adoring himself
here's seven years' bad luck
(i wanna tell him)
when you say you love me
you're just flattering your vanity
but i don't need your practised lines
your school of charm mentality
so save your breath for someone else
and credit me with something more
when it comes to men like you
i know the score, i've heard it all before
ooh, you're such a ladykiller
always on a winner
thinking that you're in there
oh boy, you're such a ladykiller
super-sexy mister
call it what you will, oh
you'll think you're such a ladykiller
i just bet you're still there
posing in the mirror
hey girls, he's such a ladykiller
but we know where he's coming from
and we know the score
fascinating new thing
you delight me
and i know you're speaking of me
fascinating new thing
get beside me
i want you to love me
i'm surprised that you've never been told before
that you're lovely and you're perfect
and that somebody wants you
fascinating new thing
the scene-makin'
want a temporary savior
fascinating new thing
don't betray them
by becoming familiar
i'm surprised that you've never been told before
that you're priceless and you're precious
even when you are not new
[la x 23]
[end chorus]
i'm surprised that you've never been told before
that you're priceless, yeah you're holy
even when you are not new
(fascinating new thing x 8)
i gotta speak and you want to listen up
there is no time to feast your eyes
you want it all but the world won't give it up
up to the edge your star will rise
[pre-chorus]
what is your weapon of choice
what's your weapon of choice
there is no weapon to free us all
what is your weapon of choice
what's your weapon of choice
there is no weapon to free us all
i won't waste it, i won't waste it
i won't waste my love on a nation
i won't waste it, i won't waste it
i won't waste my love on a nation
everyone's got their own split factions
every pawn will pay it's price
i've been digging out in all directions
i'll see you through to the after life
[pre-chorus]
what is your weapon of choice
what's your weapon of choice
there is no weapon to free us all
what is your weapon of choice
what's your weapon of choice
there is no weapon to free us all
i won't waste it, i won't waste it
i won't waste my love on a nation
i won't waste it, i won't waste it
i won't waste my love on a nation
it's too hard to stand aside
it's enough to stop your heart
i won't waste it, i won't waste it
i won't waste my love on a nation
i won't waste it, i won't waste it
i won't waste my love on a nation
i won't waste it, i won't waste it
i won't waste my love on a nation
i won't waste it, i won't waste it
i won't waste my love on a nation
our love is like water
pinned down and abused for being strange
our love is no other
than me alone, for me all day
our love is like water
pinned down and abused, ayy
all over you, all over me
the sun, the fields, the sky
i've often tried to hold the sea
the sun, the fields, the tide
pay me now, lay me down
oh, yeah
our love is like water
pinned down and abused for being strange
our love is no other
than me alone, for me all day
our love is like angels
pinned down and abused, ayy
all over you, all over me
the sun, the fields, the sky
i've often tried to hold the sea
the sun, the fields, the tide
pay me now
lay me down
pay me now, pay me now
lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
all over you, all over me
all over you, all over me
pay me now
lay me down, down
pay me now, pay me now
lay me down, lay me down, lay
our love is like water
pinned down and abused for being strange
our love is no other
than me alone, hey
all over you, all over me
the sun, the fields, the sky
i've often tried to hold the sea
the sun, the fields, the tide
pay me now
lay me down, down
pay me now, pay me now
lay me down, lay me down, lay
everything is bleak
it's the middle of the night
you're all alone
and the dummies might be right
you feel like a jerk
my music at work
my music at work
avoid trends and cliches
don't try to be up to date
and when the sunlight hits the olive oil
don't hesitate
the night's so long it hurts
my music at work
in a symbol too far
or the anatomy of a stain
to determine where you are
in a sink full of ganges i'd remain
no matter what you heard
my music at work
my music at work
my music at work
i call it "olga waits"
the crowd then entertains
the dim possibility
of showing some restraint
the rain came down berserk
my music at work
my music at work
on a star beyond the chart
or the dark side of a drop of rain
determining where you are
in a sink full of ganges i'd remain
no matter what you heard
my music at work
my music at work
my music at work
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
everything is bleak
it's the middle of the night
you're all alone
and the dummies might be right
outside the darkness lurks
my music at work
my music at work
hey, fallen hummingbird
my music at work
from the middle of the earth
my music at work
bound for bed without dessert
my music at work
my music at work
my music at work
ahh, suck a headphone!

high on the roof
thin the blood
another one came on the waves tonight
coming in, you're home
[interlude]
"we would circle and we'd circle and we'd circle
to stop and consider and centered on the pavement
stacked up all the trucks jacked up and our wheels
in slush and orange crush in pocket and all
this here county, hell, any county, it's just like heaven here
and i was remembering and i was just in a different county and all
then this whirlybird that i headed for i had my goggles pulled off;
i knew it all, i knew every back road and every truck stop"

coming in, you're home
high on the roof
thin the blood
another one came on the waves tonight
coming in, you’re home
been beat up and battered around
been sent up
and i've been shot down
you're the best thing that i've ever found
handle me with care
reputation's changeable
situation's tolerable
but, baby, you're adorable
handle me with care
[pre-chorus: roy orbison]
i'm so tired of being lonely
i still have some love to give
won't you show me that you really care?
everybody's got somebody to lean on
put your body next to mine, and dream on
i've been 
fobbed off
, and i've been fooled
i've been robbed and ridiculed
in daycare centers and night schools
handle me with care
been stuck in airports, terrorized
sent to meetings, hypnotized
overexposed, commercialized
handle me with care
[pre-chorus: roy orbison]
i'm so tired of being lonely
i still have some love to give
won't you show me that you really care?
everybody's got somebody to lean on
put your body next to mine, and dream on
i've been uptight and it made a mess
but i'll clean it up myself, i guess
oh, the sweet smell of success
handle me with care
if we still have time, we might still get by
every time i think about it, i wanna cry
with bombs and the devil
little kids keep coming
no way to breathe easy, no time to be young
[pre-chorus 1]
but i tell myself that i was doing all right
there's nothing left to do at night
but go crazy on you
crazy on you
let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
my love is the evening breeze touching your skin
the gentle, sweet singing of leaves in the wind
the whisper that calls after you in the night
and kisses your ear in the early moonlight
[pre-chorus 2]
and you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine
my love, the pleasure's mine
let me go crazy on you

if something's old, i wanna put a bit of shine on it
when something's gone, i wanna fight to get it back again
yeah, fight to get it back again
yeah
when something's broke, i wanna put a bit of fixing on it
when something's bored, i wanna put a little exciting on it
if something's low, i wanna put a little high on it
when something's lost, i wanna fight to get it back again
yeah, fight to get it back again
yeah
when signals cross, i wanna put a little straight on it
if there's no love, i wanna try to love again
i’ll say your prayers, i’ll take your side
i'll find us a way to make light
i'll dig your grave, we'll dance and sing
what's saved could be one last lifetime
[chrous]

c'mon girl, don't make a fuss
lets have a conversation that's not just about us
[pre-chorus]
we dont know which way to go
it doesn't really matter what we do
there's gonna be one good way to know
if all this is worth it, we can work it
night by night
she says i'm not romantic
i say she's too dramatic
i tell her while we're at it we can work it
night by night
[post-chorus]
night by night
night by night
night by night
i know, inside of me
if i wait a bit longer, we'll see what's meant to be
come on girl, we can't be apart
a special kind of lovin reaches right to my heart
[pre-chorus]
we don't know which way to go
it doesn't really matter what we do
there's gotta be one good way to know
if all this is worth it we can work it
night by night

i say she's too dramatic
i tell her while we're at it we can work it

we'll wash those tears away
you're young and beautiful, and i'll love you always
we got no time for pain
when it's just you and me in ecstasy, hey-ey-ey!
[instrumental]
what is with the world today
the wicked games that people play
the wars, the greed, they waste away
yeah, it's sad,

all of the lonely nights
waiting for you to come
longing to hold you tight
i need you so desperately
waiting for you to come
bringing your love to me
but i'd wait a million years
walk a million miles
cry a million tears
i'd swim the deepest sea
climb the highest hill
just to have you near me
as love is reality
when you are near to me
i am in ecstasy (whoa, whoa, whoa)
i'd swallow the pain and pride
baby, i just can't hide
all that i feel inside
and i'd wait a million years
walk a million miles
cry a million tears
i'd swim the deepest sea
climb the highest hill
just to have you near me
a million years, i would wait for you
a million tears, baby i'd be true
a million miles, i would follow you
a million years, if you want me to
pacing the floor, detest
sweat pouring down my chest
still i can't love you less (whoa, whoa, oh)
it's worth all
 the pain and pride
baby, i just can't hide
all that i feel inside
and i'd wait a million years
walk a million miles
cry a million tears
i'd swim the deepest sea
climb the highest hill
just to have you near me
i'd wait a million years
walk a million miles
cry a million tears (whoa, whoa, oh)

has our conscience shown?
has the sweet breeze blown?
has all kindness gone?
hope still lingers on
[pre-chorus 1]
i drink myself of new found pity
sittin' alone in new york city
and i don't know why
are we listening?
hymns of offering
have we eyes to see?
love is gathering
[pre-chorus]
all the words that i've been reading
have now started the act of bleeding
into one
into one
so i walk up on high
and i step to the edge
to see my world below
and i laughed at myself
while the tears rolled down
'cause it's the world i know
oh, it's the world i know
[instrumental bridge]
[pre-chorus 1]
i drink myself of newfound pity
sitting alone in new york city
and i don't know why, don't know why
so i walk up on high
and i step to the edge
to see my world below
and i laughed at myself
while the tears rolled down
'cause it's the world i have known
oh, it's the world i know
yeah, i walk up on high
and i step to the edge
to see my world below
and i laughed at myself
while the tears rolled down
'cause it's the world i have known
oh, it's the world i know
i'd like to rest my heavy head tonight
on a bed of california stars
i'd like to lay my weary bones tonight
on a bed of california stars
i'd love to feel
your hand touching mine
and tell me why
i must keep working on
yes i'd give my life
to lay my head tonight on a bed
of california stars
i'd like to dream
my troubles all away
on a bed of california stars
jump up from my starbed
make another day
underneath my california stars
they hang like grapes
on vines that shine
and warm the lovers' glass
like friendly wine
so i'd give this world
just to dream a dream with you
on our bed of california stars
i'd like to rest my heavy head tonight
on a bed of california stars
i'd like to lay my weary bones tonight
on a bed of california stars
i'd love to feel
your hand touching mine
and tell me why
i must keep working on
yes i'd give my life
to lay my head tonight on a bed
of california stars
i'd like to dream
my troubles all away
on a bed of california stars
jump up from my starbed

on vines that shine
and warm the lovers' glass
like friendly wine

just to dream a dream with you
on our bed of california stars
so i'd give this world
just to dream a dream with you
on our bed of california stars
(dream a dream with you)
light up, spark the detonator
now i'm homeward bound, way to see you later
if you make that step you're the instigator
got my mind made up, i'll be your navigator
if you want me to travel over moonlit miles
for a precious smile
following my lonely heart
call on me, take me...
far over the seas
i return in my dreams
sailing home under the stars
to be safe in your arms
ever near, travel through time
ever close in my mind
say you will truly be mine
say you'll always be mine
we are a winning combination
we're two stars aligned in a constellation
when i get too low you're my inspiration
never let me down, you're a revelation
one that comes along once in a lifetime
oh i realise
you give me love free and wild
oh my child, lead me...
far over the seas
i return in my dreams
sailing home under the stars
to be safe in your arms
ever near, travel through time
ever close in my mind
say you will truly be mine
say you'll always be mine
our empire stretches from the deserts
to the ice fields
love and courage can take us anywhere
we dare to go
far over the seas
i return in my dreams
sailing home under the stars
to be safe in your arms
ever near, travel through time
ever close in my mind
say you will truly be mine
say you'll always be mine
four thousand years ago, i came back to my senses
jumped on a laser ray and blew into a new dimension
this vertical line, i watch it go by
chopped down your masterplan in nanoseconds, man
i hope you understand that nothing living lasts forever
this vertical line, i watch it go by
i can feel it overheated
so bad, it makes me want to cry
i can feel it overheated
a burning heart 
unstuck in time
now i'm a solar flare, now i'm that light that rages
now i'm that laser ray that blows a hole right through the ages
this vertical line, i watch it go by
ain't got no secondhand, just got my good intentions
just got my laser ray exploding into new dimensions
this vertical line, i watch it go by
i can feel it overheated
so bad, it makes me want to cry
i can feel it overheated
a burning heart 
unstuck in time
[post-chorus 1]
well, i heard from the psychic sun
that she could fuse us into one
if only we could take the light
well, i got mine, yes, i got mine
four thousand years ago, i came back to my senses
swallowed a laser ray, it blew my mind in all directions
this vertical line, i watch it go by
chopped down your masterplan in nanoseconds, man
i hope you understand that nothing living lasts forever
this vertical line, i watch it go by
i can feel it overheated
so bad, it makes me want to cry
i can feel it overheated
a burning heart 
unstuck in time
[post-chorus 2]
well, i heard from the stars last night
we're only vehicles for light
so should your mind begin to shine
say "hey, alright!" say "i got mine!"
say "hey, alright!" say "i got mine!"
say "hey, alright!" say "i got mine!"
say "hey, alright!" say "i got mine!"
it's a sound in the night
that awakes your fear
they must be closed
and sure they are near
on the wand of the breeze
who could smell their fire
they sing your death
they watch the flames get higher
down backstreets you've never been
people and places you've never seen
still they lie only yards away
they are so close you can hear them say
no surrender we will not be moved
we were born red white and blue
no pope here watch the veniens run
down the barrel of a loaded gun
feal the fear
well here they come
here comes the summer (2x)
shots ring out cross the twilight sky
before night falls hear the mothers cry
in their arms just flesh and blood
we stood accused, now we've been judged
of a crime, of a crime, for wich we must pay
every year every single day
stand aside don't be afraid
here come the boys from the obergate
feal the fear
yeah here they come
here comes the summer
yeah here comes the summer
is it worth the hill
this lie you sell
hand it down through each generation
don't think about the amplication
animal, animal, animal, animal, animal, animal, animal
here comes the summer
yeah here comes the summer
yeah here they come
hey, hey, little razorblade
girl, you're so, so dangerous
you say you wanna try and get away
and that's just so obvious
i've got the keys
so let's put it into drive
hey, hey, little razorblade
girl, you're so, so serious
you're only pretty when you walk away
and you act oblivious
but i've got the keys
so let's put it into drive
but don't call it a crush
don't call it a crush, baby
you know i love you too much to be crushed like that
to be crushed like that
give back my heart tonight
i'm sick of never smiling
'cause you're so uptight
'cause we know it's not alright
but neither one of us is putting up a fight
and you're right (you're right)
that it's wrong (it's wrong)
to spend the night alone (alone)
you stand on the shore as i'm treading water
wave as i sink like a stone
hey, hey, little razorblade
girl, you're so, so obnoxious
this lucid dream is now reality
and it makes me so anxious
hey, hey, little razorblade
girl, you're so, so dangerous
you say you wanna try and get away
and that's just so obvious
i've got the keys
so let's put it into drive
but don't call it a crush
don't call it a crush, baby
you know i love you too much to be crushed like that
to be crushed like that
don't call it a crush
don't call it a crush, baby
you know i love you too much to be crushed like that
to be crushed like that
don't call it a crush
to be crushed like that
don't call it a crush
to be crushed like that
don't call it a crush, baby
to be crushed like that
don't call it a crush
to be crushed like that
i wrote the letter in blood red ink to paint the picture
i was trying to get done with the deed
you get what you give and you give nothing else
well we're all just sitting waiting
on the bombs to come and take us
so i guess it doesn't matter how you take it
take it, yeah
i'd wait a real long time, real long time, real long time
but not forever
i'd wait a real long time, real long time, real long time
well, i was sitting on a park bench out in the heat
couldn't get myself to even look away from my feet
thinking the story's complete
you kept your hands where i could hold em
kept your eyes both dark and gleaming
here's the thing, i think the whole time i was dreaming
i'd wait a real long time, real long time, real long time
but not forever
i'd wait a real long time, real long time, real long time
take it in your stride, take it in your stride, you don't have to cry
take it in your stride and you won't have to hide away
i'd wait a real long time, real long time, real long time
i still think we're all okay
how come what you want and what you get
always seem to be two different things? woah
i'd wait a real long time, real long time, real long time
not forever
i'd wait a real long time, real long time, real long time
yeah, yeah
we get it almost every night
when that moon is big and bright
it's a supernatural delight
everybody's dancing in the moonlight
everybody here is out of sight
they don't bark and they don't bite
they keep things loose, they keep 'em tight
everybody's dancing in the moonlight
dancing in the moonlight
everybody's feeling warm and bright
it's such a fine and natural sight
everybody's dancing in the moonlight
we like our fun and we never fight
you can't dance and stay uptight
it's a supernatural delight
everybody was dancing in the moonlight
dancing in the moonlight
everybody's feeling warm and bright
it's such a fine and natural sight
everybody's dancing in the moonlight
we get in almost every night
and when that moon is big and bright
it's a supernatural delight
everybody's dancing in the moonlight

everybody's feeling warm and bright
it's such a fine and natural sight

let's have bizarre celebrations
let's forget who, forget what, forget where
we'll have bizarre celebrations
i'll play the satyr in cyprus, you the bride being stripped bare
let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in antarctica
let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in antarctica
let's have bizarre celebrations
let's forget when, forget what, forget how
we'll have bizarre celebrations
we'll play tristan and iseult, 
but make sure i see white sails
let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in antarctica
let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in antarctica
maybe i'll never die
i'll just keep growing younger with you
and you'll grow younger, too
now it seems too lovely to be true
but i know the best things always do
let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in antarctica
let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in antarctica
let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in antarctica

let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in antarctica
let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in antarctica
you say "i love you" while you're with somebody else
i should have known that you were only in it for yourself
i hate to tell ya but he isn't with you for your brain, no, no
i bet you probably even have to have this song explained
i saw you hold his hand and walk across the street one day
you and your lover never made it out of the way
so i guess you'll never dance again
, whoa-oh
guess you'll never dance again
, whoa-oh
i guess you'll never dance again
i kinda thought you'd be a little quicker on your feet
being graceful doesn't help you, baby, when you cheat, no, no, no
you ate the pavement after all the little games you played
and met the bumper of the driver that you betrayed
[final chorus]
so i guess you'll never dance again
, whoa-oh
guess you'll never dance again
, whoa-oh
i guess you'll never dance again
 (never-never, never-never), whoa-oh (never-never, never-never)
guess you'll never dance again
 (never-never, never-never), whoa-oh (never-never)
i guess you'll never dance again
went down to mexico
i drove my black el camino
i met up with an old gringo
he showed me round, and said to call him joe
i was there about a week or so

i had a dream about a girl i used to know
she said "i got to warn ya bout mexico and california"
she said "i got to warn ya bout mexico and california"
oh, yeah
she said "i got to warn ya bout mexico and california"
earthquakes and sharks to start us off
if chupacabras ain't enough
black widow spiders and killer bees
there ain't no shade, there ain't no trees
hot desert heat and polluted air
and traffic jams beyond compare
that's all i got to warn ya bout mexico and california
woke up and said i got to go
doc said "relax, and take it slow"
i tried to argue, but don't you know
bout california and mexico?
right then, the doctor hit the floor
the building shook, then shook some more
i looked down at him and swore
"you son of a bitch! i told you so!"
earthquakes and sharks to start us off
if chupacabras ain't enough
black widow spiders and killer bees
there ain't no shade, there ain't no trees
hot desert heat and polluted air
and traffic jams beyond compare
that's all i got to warn ya bout mexico and california

every night my dream’s the same
same old city with a different name
men are coming to take me away
i don’t know why but i know i can’t stay
there’s a weight that’s pressing down
late at night you can hear the sound
even the noise you make when you sleep
can’t swim across a river so deep
they know my name cause i told it to them
but they don’t know where
they don’t know when it’s coming, when it’s coming
there’s this fear i keep so deep
knew its name since before i could speak, yeah, oh
they know my name cause i told it to them
but they don’t know where
they don’t know when, it’s coming
oh when, that it’s coming, keep the car running
if some night i don’t come home
please don’t think i’ve left you alone
the same place animals go when they die
you can’t climb across a mountain so high
the same city where i go when i sleep
you can’t swim across a river so deep
they know my name cause i told it to them
but they don’t know where
they don’t know when, it’s coming
oh when, is it coming, keep the car running
keep the car running
keep the car running
it's 6 a-m and the

to all our love letters
some postman is gonna cry

you crushed paper hearts
stole and sold and ripped apart
promise with stamps

some postman you turned out to be!

how can you have everything and nothing to lose?
you and nobody see eye to eye
you're gonna wake up with a ghost instead of a guy
bulletin board on the wall of a church
soaking up the city from a top-step perch
you're gonna break down on a midnight date
you're gonna curse this town, you're gonna run late
you're pretty as a penny
rollerskate skinny
you're pretty as a penny
rollerskate skinny
do you want to meet up at the pickwood bowl?
we could knock nine down and leave one in the hole
wouldn't be here if the athenia hadn't sunk
or if dear 'ol dad hadn't got so drunk
every other day is a kick in the shin
every other day it's like the day just went
but you make it alright, you make it okay
you make me sorta glad that i waited till today
you're pretty as a penny
rollerskate skinny
you're pretty as a penny
rollerskate skinny
rollerskate skinny and the terrible two's
two years in and it's time to choose
love feels good when it sits right down
puts its feet up on the table it and sends a bowl around
ain't nobody gonna see eye to eye
with a girl who's only gonna stand collarbone high
rain's gonna come in fair-sized drips
we're gonna go to heaven wearing paper-hat ships
you're pretty as a penny
rollerskate skinny
you're pretty as a penny
rollerskate skinny
i believe in love but it don't believe in
i believe in love but it don't believe in me
i believe in love but it don't believe in me
no it don't believe in
don't believe in
how can you have everything and nothing to lose?
you and nobody see eye to eye
changing strings and banging on things
a couple of girls from the school
would listen to kiss
with rockets for fists
acting like saturday's fool
learned how to smoke, told dirty jokes
talked about loose girls from rome
i made out with most of them
so i raised a toast to them especially now that i'm old
and they're 45 with husbands who don't like their wives
3 or 4 kids, make enough to survive
in their paper mill jobs while their teen heartthrobs
are playing in bands or they're dead
can i go back to when i was the winner
way before the rain came
and washed away the sinners, everyone was something and
nothing was done right or wrong
smothering the cover of a '69 summer
played through a speaker of fuzz
nobody knew bryan adams wasn't cool
the tv just told me he was
always heard the sound, get me out of this town
resonating clear on my head
chuck ran away with our gear and the drugs
i'm pretty sure that he's dead
or he's 46 and alone, cast the heaviest stone
suburban cover band playing bad to the bone
in a bath tub of meth, you can smell your own death
you know when you can't look the past in the eye
can i just go back to when i was the winner
way before the rain came
and washed away the sinners, everyone was something
(and i could never do any wrong)
went back to the woods where i hid all my goods
in a rusted out cadillac door
we all get nostalgic and fall for the hat trick
of thinking it'll be like before
like the football jocks trying to please their pops
and the stoners aping everything their bad uncles taught
and the teachers who cared more than i ever knew
and knew i played clubs, let me sleep through school
and my day job boss who wrote it up as a loss
but let me leave when i wanted and i never got caught
sleeping out on the field, in the back of my truck
breaking into the bars, steal the beer and getting fucked
by a girl twice my age, making minimum wage
but the tan lines were good and she had a good face
is this what i've become? is this all i've become?
when do i become
i want to go back to when i was the winner
way before the rain came
and washed away the sinners, everyone was someone and
and i could never do any wrong
i'm standing at your back porch baby
come answer your door
i'll give you what you want little lady
can't take any more
hey!
if it's love that you want from me
no way!

you came out of nowhere
stealing my heart and brain
flaming my every cell
you make me feel myself
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
will you stay in this land forever?
will you stay in this land forever?
across the time and space
a never-ending dance
a blooming and a trance
you make me feel my soul
there's no more loneliness
only sparkles and sweat
there's no more single fate
you make me feel myself
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
will you stay in this land forever?
will you stay in this land forever?
[monologue: morgan kibby]
my body is like a lightning rod
capsize me and douse me in your bay
a shiver of want, always
when you are on the tip of my tongue
in the back of your parked car
i could build a fort
and play all day
between your lips, and mine
let's stay here forever
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
will you stay in this land forever?
will you stay in this land forever?
animals on tv singing about some pain that they once felt
there's no one i disapprove of more or root for more than myself
i wanted to pretend that it was better, better, better on the phone
i didn't wanna tell you i was jealous, jealous, jealous and alone
so we talk about ourselves in hell
to forget the love we never felt
all the old jokes that work so well
universal truth was a moment's lie
don't try to stop us
don't try to stop us
don't try to stop us
get out of the way
got to get to climb your tree in the light of the living ghost i see
she sees her father in that old man's eyes while secretly he stares at her thighs
animals on tv singing about some pain they felt at some point
i didn't wanna tell you i was jealous, jealous, jealous, what's the point?
as i watch the velvet drapes appear
and the door was closed for forty years
as we hide what we don't wanna hear
as we hide what's really in our ears
he is coming from a part of hell
where lightning blue eyes don't go down well
he can tell that we're oblivious
it's addiction of routine as well
making fools out of the best of us
making robots of the rest of us
innocence itself in america today
is a crime just like cornel west might say
don't try to stop us
don't try to stop us
don't try to stop us
get out of the way
heart beat sounding
ricocheting in their cage
thought i'd lose my balance
with the grounds bounce and sway
and all this violence
and all this goes away
and the vibes that rise like
fireflies illuminate our play
some light being
pulled you up from night's party
said clap your hands
if you think your soul is free
and the silence was astounding
'kept some "oh lord!! mercy me's"
and oh you can't stop what's coming up
you're never going to stop going to live it up
and oh it's going to drop going to fill your cup
and oh it's going to drop going to fill your cup
the age of miracles
the age of sound
well there's a golden age
coming round, coming round, coming round
give it up
'stead of grabbing for decay
what we viewed as gold
i believe pollutes this space
and its grace ascending
like a snake up your tree
up your happy ending understanding
all your supposed to be
let it move right in
let it kiss your face
let it sow your skin
in perpetual embrace
like i said "love's light is laughter"
like the sun spitting happiness into the hereafter
oh here it comes like a natural disaster
ah blowing up like a ghetto blaster
ah here it comes, bring it faster
ah here it comes, bring it faster
the age of miracles
the age of sound
well there's a golden age
coming round, coming round, coming round
love, don't you falter
burning hearts
dragged behind
the horses dancing on the altar
hooves breaking gods
to diamond dust and stars
and there you are
now we're all allowed to breathe
walls dissolve
with the hunger and the greed
move your body
you've got all you need
and your arms in the air stir a sea of stars
and oh here it comes and it's not so far
all light beings
come on now make haste
clap your hands
if you think you're in the right place
thunder all surrounding
aw feel it quake with the joy resounding
palm to the palm you can feel it pounding
never give it up you can feel it mounting
oh its going to drop going to fill your cup and
oh its going to drop going to fill your cup
the age of miracles
the age of sound
well there's a golden age
coming round, coming round, coming round
the age of miracles
the age of sound
well there's a golden age
coming round, coming round, coming round
hey, hey, you
tell me how have you been?
you could have a steam train
if you just lay down your tracks
you could have an aeroplane flying
if you bring your blue sky back
all you do is call me
i'll be anything you need
you could have a big dipper
going up and down, all around the bends
you could have a bumper car, bumping
this amusement never ends
i wanna be your sledgehammer
why don't you call my name?
oh, let me be your sledgehammer
this will be my testimony
show me 'round your fruit cage
'cause i will be your honey bee
open up your fruit cage
where the fruit is as sweet as can be
i wanna be your sledgehammer
why don't you call my name?
you'd better call the sledgehammer
put your mind at rest

no matter where i turn
i can't escape your double face
don't want to listen to the radio
or stick around just to hear:
[pre-chorus]
how could we make it without you?
i should have known better to doubt you
i thought i heard the end of it
and now i know how far you'd go
to be the next freak show
american psycho
cover of the magazines, patron saint to troubled teens
wish i'd never heard your name
tomorrow could be just another day
a misdemeanor or a felony, that's ok
don't wanna wait for a second chance
it's your turn for the spotlight, the big dance
[pre-chorus]
how could we make it without you?
i should have known better to doubt you
i thought i'd heard the end of it
now i know how far you'd go
to be the next freak show
american psycho
cover of the magazines, patron saint to troubled teens
wish i'd never heard your name
[post-chorus]
they all wanna know
but i already know
what am i supposed to do?
when you know that it's all true
that you stole, that you lied, that you know
[post-chorus]
primadonna, self absorbed
wide awake and never bored
party, binge and purgency
results of plastic surgery
spotted at the hottest shows
interview on charlie rose
they all want a piece of you
and now i know how far you'd go
to be the next freak show
american psycho
cover of the magazines, patron saint to troubled teens
wish i never heard your name
they all wanna know
how far you'd had to go
and i already know
how far you'd had to go
so i thought i was by myself
until i found somebody else
to pretend i am i know i've gone too far
it's not like we see the same things
even though we're both human beings
i can send my love to show just what we are
[pre-chorus]
i really think a phase is an easy way to put it
i really think i'm crazy
i just can't seem to get through this thing
i fall through
didn't even see you
i'm going so fast now
i just see a blur
i fall through
didn't wanna ask you
i'll just take this last bow
think of what we were
i fall through
didn't even see you
i'm going so fast now
i just see a blur
i fall through
didn't wanna ask you
i'll just take this last bow
think of what we were
thinking of my fixation
is better in moderation
i pretend i'm fine i know you are a star
[pre-chorus]
i'm really fucking tired of depending on the crowd
i'm really full of love but sometimes
i just can't get out of this thing
i fall through
didn't even see you
i'm going so fast now
i just see a blur
i fall through
didn't wanna ask you
i'll just take this last bow
think of what we were
i fall through
didn't even see you
i'm going so fast now
i just see a blur
i fall through
didn't wanna ask you
i'll just take this last bow
think of what we were
i was on the outside
when you said, you said you needed me
and i was looking at myself
i was blind, i could not see
a boy tries hard to be a man
his mother takes him by his hand
if he stops to think, he starts to cry
oh, why?
if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
i will follow
i was on the inside
when they pulled the four walls down
i was looking through the window
i was lost, i am found
walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
i will follow
your eyes make a circle
i see you when i go in there
your eyes
your, your, your eyes
your eyes, just give me
your, your, your eyes
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
if you walk away, walk away
i walk away, walk away
i will follow
i will follow
i will follow
i will follow
i will follow

(he started the day with a mood and a shake)
(he was finely arranged)
(and someone said with a cold, hard chest, "you're a mess!")
(he woke up at nights)
(he thought he was twice)

he's walking along with his soul in his lungs
(ba dum, ba dum, ba da dum)
you stare at him long, you can find a new song
(ba dum, ba dum, ba da dum)
everyone thinks they've got a new phrase
(ba dum, ba dum, ba da dum)
but you're still miles away
you're still miles away
i said, "you're still miles away"

[symphonic outro]
balancing on one wounded wing
circling the edge of the never-ending
the best of the vanished marvels
have gathered inside your door
more than begin, but less than forget
but spirits born from the not happened yet
gathering there to pay off a debt
brought back from the wars
we thought we lost you
we thought we lost you
we thought we lost you
welcome back
sleeping for years, pick through what is left
through the pieces that fell and rose from the depth
from the rainwater well
deep as a secret nobody knows
less than forget, but more than begun
these adventures in solitude never done
to the names of our rooms
we send the same blood back from the wars
we thought we lost you
we thought we lost you
we thought we lost you
it will all come back
i know you want to run far away from one more
and that it's coming at a bad time
some cold grace, countless ways
for all we know
i know you need to breathe through, come back, come to
but it's coming at a bad time
some lost heart, tangled days
for all we know
[instrumental interlude]
i know you want to run far away from one more
and that it's coming at a bad time
some cold grace, countless ways
for all we know
i know you want to breathe through, come back, come to
but it's coming at a bad time
old scarred face, survivor's gold
for all we know
we met in the east
poured in like a flood
you're the whispering kind
dark sapphire blood
you're a vision of veils
all shimmery white
like a backdrop of sails
all aglow from the light
of the wonder behind
at a starry night
in the mountain's song
in the blue jay's call
my heartbeat flows
in crystal water falls
you were so beautiful
in your elegant bed
you'd have my blues
for your nantucket reds
i'd wait in the dark
balanced on a thread
so i'd wait in the dark
balanced on this thread
and under the church-light
you stand there
with your wicked blood and your curls
yeah, under the church-light
you stand there
in your fur and your pearls
these lines were here
long before we came around
yeah, these lines were here
and there's an ember in the rafters
and it's going to bring this whole thing down
in the neon mist
i heard you breathe
an exquisite sound
some secret symphony
your silken skin
my fingers rough
in the midnight dim
we went home and touched
beneath the chandeliers
and your persian's dust
beneath your chandeliers
and your persian's dust
and under the church-light
you stand there
with your wicked blood and your curls
yeah, under the church-light
you stand there
in your fur and your pearls
these lines were here
long before we came around
yeah, these lines were here
and there's an ember in the rafters
and it's going to bring this whole thing down
when you sing
when you sing
the stars fill up my eyes
galaxies pour down my cheeks
galaxies
galaxies that flood the street
galaxies
when we dance
when we dance
eels and seagrass float on by
i'm ten thousand leagues beneath the sea
ten thousand leagues
ten thousand leagues
ten thousand leagues beneath the green
ten thousand leagues
when we kiss
when we kiss
bears and boulders vibrate through the air
gravity is dead you see
all i need is beating red
no gravity...
in the shadows of tall buildings
of fallen angels on the ceilings
oily feathers in bronze and concrete
faded colors, pieces left incomplete
the line moves slowly past the electric fence
across the borders between continents
in the cathedrals of new york and rome
there is a feeling that you should just go home
and spend a lifetime finding out just where that is
in the shadows of tall buildings
the architecture is slowly peeling
marble statues and glass dividers
someone is watching all of the outsiders
the line moves slowly through the numbered gate
past the mosaic of the head of state
in the cathedrals of new york and rome
there is a feeling that you should just go home
and spend a lifetime finding out just where that is
[instrumental interlude]
in the shadows of tall buildings
of open arches endlessly kneeling
sonic landscapes echoing vistas
someone is listening from a safe distance
the line moves slowly into a fading light
a final moment in the dead of the night
in the cathedrals of new york and rome
there is a feeling that you should just go home
and spend a lifetime finding out just where that is
in the cathedrals of new york and rome
there is a feeling that you should just go home
and spend a lifetime finding out just where that is
woke up on the sand and
i tied up my sleeping bag
a jetty won't last forever
waves tumble and tumble
stone by stone
i ended here all alone
and brick by brick
i woke myself from happiness
and eucalyptus piled high
i'm shivering by a flaming fire
too much time
ah oh
too much time gone by
and i can't find you if i try
too much time
ah oh
too much time gone by
and i can't find you if i try
rolled up my mat and
i've got no obligations
packed up my pots and pans and
freedom is overrated
stone by stone
i left my only home
and brick by brick
woke myself from happiness
and dead fur and almond wood
storm crosses over mount hood
ive got too much time
ahh ooh
too much time gone by
and i can't find you if i try
too much time
ahh ooh
too much time gone by
and i can't find you if i try
too much time
ahh ooh
too much time gone by
and i can't find you if i try
too much time
ahh ooh
too much time gone by
and i can't find you if i try
boys and girls in cars
dogs and birds on lawns
from here i can touch the sun
put your jackets on
i feel we’re being born
the tropic of capricorn is below
we stall above the pole
still your face is young
as we feel our weight return
a trail of shooting stars
the horses call the storm
because the air contains the charge
the radio is on
and houston knows the score
can you feel it we’re almost home
the crew compartment’s breaking up
the crew compartment’s breaking up
the crew compartment’s breaking up
the crew compartment’s breaking up
this is all i wanted to bring home to you
the crew compartment’s breaking up
the crew compartment’s breaking up
the crew compartment’s breaking up
just living on a sunday morning
got my toast and tea and i'm warm and
i just thought i'd think about
all the things to get and keep getting
never enough, not enough and never ending

gears turning that no wrench can attack
consideration or pause had their time come and pass
no gloves, bet you can't get enough
make a fine parade so the public sways in your wake
and i just thought that i would go till the money's gone
i never wanted to fake it
now i can't stop till everyone who ever done me wrong
knows i’m not willing to take it
boy, you've got a hard time
bring yourself to glory
you've got a hard time
bring yourself to glory
i never wanted my name up in bright lights
but i think that i might be there soon
i owe it all to you (i owe it all to you)
hey, i was never looking for fame or the limelight
but i think that i might be there soon
i owe it all to you
no one ever told me 
what it meant to be alone
i had to learn on my lonesome
now every feigning flame i chance upon
i put the fire on
i keep my wheels in motion
